# I have less than 2.6GB stored now, which is about $0.06 / Month with $0.023 /
# GB / Month. That's okay.

# AMI backed by EBS gp3
#   $0.10/GB/Month
#   I have 11 AMIs. Let's say the average is about 10GB.
#   11 * 10GB * $0.1/GB/Month = $11 Month. This is something to think about.
#
# Move old AMIs to the machines at gatech. Like to glacier.

# Data transfer out to Internet: $0.09 per GB
#   Compared with the storage price, it's better to move it out when you don't use it for more than 1 month.

# Cleaning up a lot of not-so-important AMIs
