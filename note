TODO
----
- Admission control. Launch a new cluster when the number of nodes in each DC
	is less than 12. InstMonitor has the info.

- When a cluter is cleaned by ClusterCleaner, re-launch the job (make the same
	job request again).


Note
----
Installing boto3 on El Capitan
  https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3165
  $ sudo pip install boto3 --upgrade --ignore-installed six


Clean up logs before making a new AMI. You may want to put something in /var/log
	$ sudo rm -rf /var/log/acorn \
	  && sudo rm /var/log/cloud-init*


Done
----
- When a cluster doesn't start in 6 mins, kill the instances. Spot
	requests don't need to be cancelled. They are one-time requests.
	With the async cluster start, this is achieved for nothing.

- Need a log file, mapping job_id and parameters.
  - Job request
	  - Received
		- Served
		- Failed
	- Job completion
		- Received
		- Served
		- Failed: I haven't seen it fails.

- When a cluster doesn't finish within 1 hr, kill it. It happens with a 11 node
	cluster. One example is that one of the nodes didn't clone code from
	github.com
    sudo: unable to resolve host ip-172-31-17-235
		Cloning into '/home/ubuntu/work/acorn-tools'...
		fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/hobinyoon/acorn-tools.git/': Could not resolve host: github.com

- When a job controller sees an acorn-server cluster with less than 11 nodes
	for 6 mins, terminate the cluster. job-controller will get the job request in
	1 hour after the visibility timeout.  This happens quite often, due to the
	spot price increase. Setting the spot request price really high can be a good
	idea too.

- term-inst.py
  - Kill all instances without job_id

- Pick an AZ with the lowest last-day max pricing.
